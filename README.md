# end2end-driving
this is an implementation of end-to-end approach to driving. In this repository, we are going to explore different models and evaluate them on datasets including

- Udacity

- Comma AI

Image preprocessing techniques applied:

- Flipping. Flipping an image horizontally and reverse the steer angle is also a valid sample.

- Brightness randomization. add random brightness noise into images.

- Shifting color channel a little bit.

- Cropping. Cropping the upper and lower parts of the image to remove sky and car's hood. 

I hope you enjoyed this project.
